# CMS
A git-based content management system for [Digital Land](https://digital-land.info)

Currently using [NetlifyCMS](https://netlifycms.org) to manage markdown files with structured frontmatter to generate specifications consumed by digital-land web-apps to show content in various pages.

## Running the CMS locally
